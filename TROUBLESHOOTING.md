# Troubleshooting Guide for Khalid's Portfolio Project

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Missing internal.js file
```
Error: Failed to load url /.svelte-kit/generated/server/internal.js (resolved id: /.svelte-kit/generated/server/internal.js)
```

This error occurs because SvelteKit needs to generate internal files before it can run properly, but the project initialization failed.

### Solutions:

1. **Run with initialization script** (Preferred)
   ```
   npm run setup
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will create necessary placeholder files in the `.svelte-kit` directory.

2. **Use alternate Vite configuration** (Fallback)
   ```
   npm run dev:alt
   ```
   This bypasses SvelteKit and runs a direct Vite configuration with the necessary aliases.

## Alternative Approaches

We've implemented two different ways to run the project:

1. **SvelteKit approach with initialization script**
   - Uses the standard SvelteKit setup
   - Creates missing files that SvelteKit needs
   - Maintains the original project structure

2. **Direct Vite approach** 
   - Bypasses SvelteKit entirely
   - Uses Vite directly with the necessary aliases
   - Serves as a fallback if the SvelteKit approach doesn't work

## How to Build for Production

1. **SvelteKit build**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Alternative Vite build**
   ```
   npm run build:alt
   ```

## Dependencies and Versions

This project works with:
- SvelteKit 1.20.4 (not compatible with newer SvelteKit 2.x/3.x)
- Vite 4.4.2
- Svelte 4.0.5

## Project Structure

The portfolio follows a clean component-based architecture:
- Main sections in `/src/lib/components/`
- Animations in `/src/lib/components/animated/`
- Data in `/src/lib/data/`
- Type definitions in `/src/lib/types/`

## Recommendations

1. For a permanent fix, consider migrating to a fresh SvelteKit project:
   ```
   npm create svelte@latest new-portfolio
   ```

2. Then copy over the components, data, and styles from this project to the new one.

3. The current workarounds should be considered temporary solutions to get the project running quickly.
