# Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Problem
Your project was experiencing dependency conflicts because:
- You were using Svelte 5 (svelte@5.30.2)
- But some dependencies like `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte-inspector` and `svelte-hmr` expected Svelte 3 or 4 as peer dependencies

## Solution

I've updated your `package.json` to resolve these conflicts by:

1. Downgrading to Svelte 4 (the latest 4.x version)
2. Upgrading SvelteKit and related packages to be compatible
3. Upgrading Vite to version 5 (required by newer SvelteKit)

### Changes Made:
- `svelte`: ^5.30.2 → ^4.2.19
- `@sveltejs/adapter-auto`: ^2.0.0 → ^3.0.0
- `@sveltejs/kit`: ^1.20.4 → ^2.0.0
- `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte`: ^2.5.0 → ^3.0.0
- `vite`: ^4.0.0 → ^5.0.0

## Next Steps

1. Delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file
2. Run `npm install` to install the updated dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to verify everything works correctly

## Alternative Approach

If you specifically need Svelte 5 for your project, you would need to:
1. Wait for the ecosystem to fully support Svelte 5
2. Or use specific versions of dependencies that already support Svelte 5
3. Or use override settings in package.json to force compatibility

## Svelte 5 Considerations

Note that Svelte 5 introduces significant changes with its "Runes" API. If you're building a production site, consider sticking with Svelte 4 until the ecosystem fully supports version 5. If you're experimenting with Svelte 5 features, be prepared to deal with some compatibility issues.
